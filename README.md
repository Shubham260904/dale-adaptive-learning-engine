# DALE — Adaptive Learning Engine

*Purpose:*  
DALE is an adaptive interview preparation engine that auto adjusts difficulty for each user across DSA, CS core, and HR using an ELO-like rating + semantic scoring.

## Problems it solves
1. Removes wasted time on wrong difficulty questions.
2. Unifies multi-domain prep (DSA, OOPS, OS, DBMS, HR) in one adaptive system.
3. Gives measurable rating feedback and growth trend.
4. Eliminates “what should I solve next?” confusion.
5. Acts like a personal mentor that learns your skill.
